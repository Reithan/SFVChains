# SFVChains
Analysis of SFV frame data to generate all possible combos

# Purpose
This project was a silly idea to attempt parsing through SFV frame data to attempt to generate all possible combos in an attempt to find the most optimized combos possible for a character.

# Credits
Frame data was acquired from [leaked Prima Guide](https://imgur.com/a/LstFZ) photos on Imgur, and frame data pulled from screen data in-game [by ToolAssisted](http://toolassisted.github.io/OKI/#IBK/)
